# Gallery Images

Place exactly five images in this folder with these filenames:

- photo1.jpg
- photo2.jpg
- photo3.jpg
- photo4.jpg
- photo5.jpg

Notes:
- Files placed under `public/` are served at the site root in Vite. These will be available at `/gallery/photoX.jpg`.
- Recommended size: at least 800px on the shortest side for good quality. JPG or PNG are fine; if you use PNG, update the extension in `src/pages/Index.tsx`.
- You can replace these files anytime; the gallery will pick them up automatically on refresh.

Total gallery count is fixed to 8 images: 5 local photos (above) + 3 existing online images.
